        <h2>White hats vs Black hats</h2>
        <p>The never ending battle between White hats and black hats, the internet has often 
            been refered to as the wild west and that is where these names come from. You got 
            white hats being the good guys protecting the general public from the black hats.
            As more things get connected to the internet more different parts of our everyday
            lives become susceptible having their lives impacted by hackers.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">As IoT is fast sweeping the nation</a></p>

        <h2>hacking as a hobby</h2>
        <p>Then there are people like me who do it more as a pass time for things like CTF or 
            other interesting games. CTF is a fun game where someone sets up a website and its 
            basically like capture the flag you use different methods to break in an get a file
            name.<a href="https://ctf.hacker101.com/about">You can learn more about CTF here</a></p>
